# How to install

##

<br/>

* First go to your local terminal and type this command in order to install this plugin

  <br/>

    ```bash
    $ node glue add functions.action <instance-name>
    ```

  <br/>
  <br/>

* For example, In my case I wanted to install **action plugin instance** with my instance
  name as **“action”**, then I will follow this pattern to install action plugin instance in
  my app:

  <br/>
  
    ```bash
    $ node glue add functions.action action
    ```
    
    Here my instance name is **action**.

  <br/>


* If the plugin is installed successfully then you can go and see that inside **backend** 
  folder there is folder named “**functions**” and inside that **functions** folder, there
  is a new folder which is named after your instance i.e. **action** is created. 
  
  Overall directory path for the **action plugin instance** should be something like this:
  
  **backend/functions/action**
